# ðŸ’³ Loan Approval Project

This project aims to use historical loan data to analyse and identify possible loan defaulters. 

We dive into the data to better understand what the data comprises of, how defaulters differ from non-defaulters based on their individual profile such as 
their annual income, cleaning and transforming the data, choosing which classifier  to use, and tuning the chosen classifier to identify whether or not a 
profile would default or not.
