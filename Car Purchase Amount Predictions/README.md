# ðŸš— Car Purchase Amount Predictions


**Overview:** <br>
The project aims to use artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict car purchase amounts by analysing historical buyers' demographic and financial attributes. The project seeks to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the amount a potential buyer will spend on a car based on their characteristics.

**Tools Used and Approach:** <br>
The process involves a combination of data preprocessing, visualisation, feature scaling, model construction, training, and evaluation. Specifically, data manipulation using Pandas, data visualisation using Matplotlib and Seaborn, feature scaling with StandardScaler from Scikit-learn, and deep learning model creation and training with Keras.
