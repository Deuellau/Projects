| Project Name | Scope | Libraries | Description |
|---|---|---|---| 
|🏃 [Understanding Obesity](https://github.com/Deuellau/Projects/blob/main/Understanding%20Obesity/Understanding%20Obesity%20(Prediction).ipynb) | EDA, ML | `seaborn` `scikit-learn` |  Explored 16 lifestyle features to predict weight categories, providing valuable insights into influential factors, emphasising lifestyle elements in weight categorisation. |
|💬 [Text Spam Classifier](https://github.com/Deuellau/Projects/blob/main/Text%20Spam%20Classifier/Text%20Spam%20Classification.ipynb)| EDA, ML |`seaborn` `scikit-learn` | Comparative analysis between ham (non-spam) and spam messages and developed a text spam classifier utilizing SMS data from diverse sources. |
|🔢 [MNIST Digit Classification](https://github.com/Deuellau/Projects/tree/main/MNIST%20Digit%20Classification)| DL | `keras` `scikit-learn` | Built and trained a robust CNN using TensorFlow and Keras for accurate MNIST digit classification, using over 800,000 parameters in model architecture. |
|💳 [Loan Approval](https://github.com/Deuellau/Projects/tree/main/Loan%20Approval) | EDA, ML |`seaborn` `scikit-learn` | Explored the differences between defaulters and non-defaulters, and built various models to predict whether individuals would default or not. |
|🚲 [Bike Sharing Analysis](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Deuellau/Projects/blob/main/Bike%20Sharing%20Analysis/Bike%20Sharing%20Analysis.html) | EDA | `dplyr` `ggplot` | Analysed over 3 million records to understand how casual and member riders differ, and what factors may lead to casual riders buying memberships.|
| ☁️ [Weather Forecasting](https://github.com/Deuellau/Projects/blob/main/Weather%20Forecasting/Weather%20Forecasting.ipynb) | ML | `matplotlib` `prophet` |Utilised Prophet to forecast daily mean temperature for 2022 using seven years of historical data. |
|🚗 [Car Purchase Amount Predictions](https://github.com/Deuellau/Projects/blob/main/Car%20Purchase%20Amount%20Predictions/Car%20Purchase%20Amount%20Predictions.ipynb) | DL | `keras` `scikit-learn` | Utilised Keras framework to construct an ANN aimed at predicting the amount for car purchases. |
