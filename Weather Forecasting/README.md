# ☁️ Weather Forecasting


**Overview:** <br>
The project's objective is to employ Prophet forecasting tool to predict daily mean temperature for the year 2022. By analysing seven years' worth of historical daily temperature records, the project aims to develop a reliable forecasting model that captures underlying patterns, seasonality, and trends in temperature data. 

**Tools Used and Approach:** <br>
The project involves loading a climate dataset, preprocessing the data, visualizing trends, and using the Prophet library to create and evaluate temperature forecasts. Pandas is employed for data manipulation, while Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for data visualization. The Prophet library facilitates time-series forecasting. The code sequentially loads data, preprocesses it, visualizes trends, trains a Prophet forecasting model, generates forecasts, and evaluates forecast performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
