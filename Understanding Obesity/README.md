# üèÉ Understanding Obesity


**Overview:** <br>
The project aims to provides valuable insights into predicting weight categories based on lifestyle and health-related features through understanding of the factors influencing weight categorisation. Data comprises of individuals between the age of 14 and 61 with and diverse eating habits and physical condition from  Mexico, Peru and Colombia.

**Tools Used and Approach:** <br>
The project  examines 16 features using Python libraries, encompassing data exploration and analysis. After data preparation, various classification algorithms undergo hyperparameter tuning to discern which algorithm best suits the data. The top-performing model, determined through this process, is then employed to understand the importance of individual features. This step allows a granular understanding of the factors that significantly contribute to accurate predictions. Overall, the project provides a comprehensive exploration of predictive factors in weight categorization, emphasizing the importance of specific lifestyle elements revealed through the chosen modeling approach.
