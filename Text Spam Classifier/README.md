# ðŸ’¬ Text Spam Classifier


**Overview:** <br>
Implemented a text spam classification project using various machine learning models, focusing on logistic regression. The steps include data understanding, exploratory data analysis, data preparation, and model development. [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) comprises of tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research.

**Tools Used and Approach:** <br>
Utilised Python libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, and Scikit-learn to build a comprehensive approach for text spam classification. The project involves EDA with visualisations like letter frequency plots and word clouds, feature engineering and transforming text data using Bag of Words for Data Preparation, and exploring various machine models that best suits the data. Optimised model is then evaluated through metrics and visualisations. Model was also tested with practical examples of the model classifying new text messages.
