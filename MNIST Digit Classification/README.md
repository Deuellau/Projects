# ðŸ”¢ MNIST Digit Classification

**Overview:** <br>
Classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project is structured to showcase a holistic approach to digit classification, combining effective data preprocessing, a well-designed architecture, and thoughtful evaluation methodologies.

**Tools Used and Approach:** <br>
Used various python tools, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn. TensorFlow and Keras frameworks were employed to build and train the CNN model, with evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix providing insights into model performance.
